-x configuration generator
--- print end result xml config to stderr for easier redirection? or print prompts to stderr and xml to stdout?
-- XSD for validation

- ensure we use docstrings in a Sphinx-compatible manner?
  https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html
  at the very least document all the functions and such so pydoc's happy.

- locking
- for docs, 3.x (as of 3.10) was 2.4M.
- Need ability to write/parse mtree specs (or a similar equivalent) for applying ownerships/permissions to overlay files

- need to package:
  python-hashid (https://psypanda.github.io/hashID/,
                 https://github.com/psypanda/hashID,
                 https://pypi.org/project/hashID/)

- package for PyPI:
